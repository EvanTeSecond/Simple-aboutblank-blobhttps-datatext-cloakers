# Simple about:blank, blob:https, and data:text cloaking devices
This repository contains simple cloakers for manipulating URLs using `about:blank`, `blob:https`, and `data:text`. These techniques are often used to create interesting behaviors in browsers or obscure direct links to certain resources for various purposes.

### 1. **about:blank Cloaker**
The `about:blank` URL is a special URL in web browsers that leads to a blank page. This can be used to redirect users to an empty, visually neutral page, often as a way to mask the actual destination or behavior of a link.
**How it works:**
- `about:blank` essentially displays a completely empty page, and you can then dynamically inject content into it via JavaScript or other methods.
- This can be useful for things like sandboxing code, or simply creating iframes.

### 2. **blob:https Cloaker**
The blob: scheme allows browsers to create URL-like objects that can represent binary data such as images, audio files, or other types of content. The blob:https version is a special use of this scheme where the content is served from the browser's memory rather than a traditional server.
**How it works:**
The blob:https URL is a dynamically generated URL which refers to content stored in the browser's memory. This content is typically not accessible to outside users unless they have access to the page that created the blob URL.
The browser uses this scheme to handle files that are temporarily available in the memory but not hosted on any external server.

### 3. **data:text Cloaker**
The data: scheme allows you to embed data directly into the URL itself, as opposed to linking to external resources. The data:text variant is used to encode text content into the URL. This can be particularly useful for embedding small amounts of data such as plain text or HTML code without the need for an external file.
**How it works:**
With data:text, you can directly encode text-based content, like HTML or plain text, into the URL, which can be rendered or processed by the browser as if it were a separate file.
It enables you to bypass the need for external resources while still linking to useful data.

## Use Cases
These cloakers can be used in various scenarios, including:
- Hiding URL details: Obfuscating the actual target URL in web applications.
- Embedding content: Storing and loading small amounts of data directly into the URL without requiring external files or resources.
- Creating sandbox environments: Displaying a blank or minimal page (like about:blank) for further manipulation without loading external resources.
